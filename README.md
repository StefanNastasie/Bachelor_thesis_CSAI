# Bachelor_thesis_CSAI
This repo contains all the files created for my Bachelor Thesis project

All files that have the .osexp extension are the OpenSesame files for the experiments

Main.py is the python script used for running the PRPC experiment

All the files containing 'clean' are meant for cleaning, arranging and preprocessing the data from the experiments

Dataset_generator is used for generating the stimuli for the PRPC task

word_extraction_updated is used for sampling the words used for the experiments.

analysis.r is the R analysis done for the first submission

Analysis_new.r is the R analysis done for the second submission

LD.r is the separate analysis done for the Lexical Decision task for the second submission
